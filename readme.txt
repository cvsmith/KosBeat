My project is a geometric music generator. The user places shapes with different
properties on the screen, and different combinations of shapes create different
sounds. 

Before running, have PyGame installed. I used PyGame's audio mixer to play all
audio. The audio exists as lots of .wav files in the folder "data", which should
be in the same directory as KosBeat.py. ScalePairs.py, KeyPairs.py, and my 
slightly modified eventBasedAnimationClass.py should also be in that same
directory.

To run, build KosBeat.py, and follow the on-screen instructions.
